## Requirements
1. openCV
2. numpy
3. pickle


## How to Run
1. Check the directory of video you want lane detection to run in `lane_detection.py`
2. If using camera check the number or if using wifi security camera, check IP
3. Run `lane_detection.py` from correct envieonment and python3

## Bugs and fixes
1. No optimization
2. Have to create auto tuner for getting the threshold values
